Task #1: Create an 8-key tone generator using Arduino uno board
The tone generator will have 8 push-button switches read by the Arduino uno-board as digital inputs.  Pressing each of the keys should generate a tone through a speaker connected to the Arduino board via a digital output.  The eight keys should be assigned with the following tone-frequencies; 300Hz, 400Hz, 500Hz, 600Hz, 700Hz, 800Hz, 900Hz and 1kHz.  Pressing the key momentarily should generate the tone for 20mS while pressing and holding the key should generate the tone continuously without any break.  When more than one key is pressed at the same time, the generated tone should have a frequency equivalent to the sum of the frequencies assigned to each key.

Design your circuit using Tinker Cad (preferred) or Wokwi simulator.  Once the Task is completed submit the following under the specific links provided.

Task #2: Modify the circuit to display key number
Add a 7-segment display to the circuit and modify your code to display the key number being pressed.  If more than 1 key is pressed, the display should alternate the key numbers at 500mS intervals.
